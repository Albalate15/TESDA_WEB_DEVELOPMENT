  <p>My Favorite Qoutes:</p>
</div>
    "If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. We need not wait to see what others do."
    <br>
    <br>
    "The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others."
    <br>
    <br>
    "Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will."
